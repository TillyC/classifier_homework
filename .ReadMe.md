###### making a classifier ...

for my final classifier titled Classifier_Class_10_HW I used the Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews data set found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset . I was aiming to assess if a classifier could determine if the film was rotten or fresh based on the language used in the review.
