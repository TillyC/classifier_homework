###### making a classifier ...

for my final classifier titled Classifier_Class_10_HW I used the Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews data set found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/rotten-tomatoes-movies-and-critic-reviews-dataset . I was aiming to assess if a classifier could determine if the film was rotten or fresh based on the language used in the review.

##### NLTK and Bayes Theorum

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) has a classifier based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on the Bayes Theorem. We want to calculate the possibility of something happening (A) based on something else already occurring (B). In this case 'A= rotten or fresh review' and 'B=The review itself'. A more detailed explanation can be found [here](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/06/naive-bayes-algorithm-everything.html).

Two important components of this algorithm are **features** and **labels**. Labels are our possible classifiers. For example, maybe we are trying to classify whether a piece of text is positive or negative, our labels would be *positive* and *negative*.

##### Outcome

The end result of my classifier was a 60% accuracy. This was improved by removing stopwords from my features keywords as well as converting those keywords to lowercase. I did add in extra keywords to try and improve this further but it didn't have any impact on the overall accuracy.
